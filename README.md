# ** Object Detection Project with Fast R-CNN **
# Overview
This project implements object detection using the Fast Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Fast R-CNN). The model is trained on the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset to recognize and localize multiple objects in images and videos.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
OpenCV
Matplotlib
